## Introduction

**CRIBS** is a unique app designed to simplify and streamline the process of short-term rentals by creating connections between renters and landlords in a fun, engaging way. Inspired by dating apps, CRIBS offers a swiping mechanism where renters can browse through property listings and swipe right on properties they love. Similarly, landlords can swipe right on potential renters who catch their interest. Once both sides express mutual interest, they match and can begin communicating.

Our goal is to make short-term rentals convenient, reliable, and trustworthy through interactive features such as a rating system and planned implementation of photo ID verification for added security.
