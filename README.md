## Introduction

**CRIBS** is a unique app designed to simplify and streamline the process of short-term rentals by creating connections between renters and landlords in a fun, engaging way. Inspired by dating apps, CRIBS offers a swiping mechanism where renters can browse through property listings and swipe right on properties they love. Similarly, landlords can swipe right on potential renters who catch their interest. Once both sides express mutual interest, they match and can begin communicating.

Our goal is to make short-term rentals convenient, reliable, and trustworthy through interactive features such as a rating system and planned implementation of photo ID verification for added security.

## Features

- **Swipe to Match**: Renters swipe right on properties they like; landlords do the same with tenant profiles.

- **Rating System**: Ratings for both properties and renters to promote accountability and trust.
- **User Profiles**: Create comprehensive profiles as a renter or landlord, complete with photos and key details.

- **Photo ID Verification (Planned)**: Future feature to enhance trust and security in the rental process.
- **Intuitive Design**: User-friendly interface designed using Figma, ensuring easy navigation.
